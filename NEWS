= NEWS

This document lists new features in the Gitorious source code. If you
are looking for detailed information about invidiual commits, use the
Git log.

=== Links to tags and branches changes - 2011-02-09

The links to branches and commits from the trees are now changed to
point to the respective trees, not commit logs as it has been in the
past. Related - when creating new tags the news bulletin now links to
the tree for that tag, rather than to its commit log which makes no
sense, and also causes Gitorious to crash.

=== Pull/push Gitorious repositories - 2011-01-27

Gitorious now lets users clone the wiki repository for a project. This
way they can update the wiki locally (all the files in the repository
is in Markdown format) and push their changes back to gitorious.org.

In the same way events are logged in the project when someone edits a
wiki page through the web interface, changes will be logged when you
push them to Gitorious. Gitorious do not currently impose any
restrictions on using branches and tags, so use Git however you see
fit to work with your repository.
