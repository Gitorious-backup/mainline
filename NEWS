=== Pull/push Gitorious repositories

Gitorious now lets users clone the wiki repository for a project. This
way they can update the wiki locally (all the files in the repository
is in Markdown format) and push their changes back to gitorious.org.

In the same way events are logged in the project when someone edits a
wiki page through the web interface, changes will be logged when you
push them to Gitorious. Gitorious do not currently impose any
restrictions on using branches and tags, so use Git however you see
fit to work with your repository.
