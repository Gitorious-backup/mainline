# Wrapper script for running Gitorious-related commands

# It will:
# - make sure the command runs as user required in gitorious.yml (if set)
# - make sure RAILS_ENV is set, defaulting to "production"
# - change current working directory to Rails app root
# - run the specified command with bundle exec, using either:
#   - $app_dir/bin/ruby (your symlink/wrapper pointing to ruby in your system)
#   - ruby (from $PATH)
