# Convenience script for performing snapshotting/backups in standard
# production environments of Gitorious.

# Performs snapshot of current Gitorious state (hosted repositories +
# database). Takes optional parameter to specify a specific
# path of tarball to restore from.

# For sites with a lot of hosted git repos, supply the SKIP_REPOS=true
# environment variable to avoid including the actual hosted repos. The
# snapshot script will then output suggestions on where to find the
# repos for your own separate backup script.

# (See /lib/tasks/backup.rake for more discussion of assumptions and
# use cases.)
#
# Examples:
#
# bin/snapshot                               # Stores snapshot as ./snapshot.tar
# bin/snapshot /tmp/backup.tar               # Stores snapshot in /tmp/backup.tar
# env SKIP_REPOS=true bin/snapshot           # Handle repositories separately
