# MySQL (default setup).  Versions 4.1 and 5.0 are recommended.
#
# Install the MySQL driver:
#   gem install mysql
# On MacOS X:
#   gem install mysql -- --include=/usr/local/lib
# On Windows:
#   gem install mysql
#       Choose the win32 build.
#       Install MySQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:

development:
  adapter: mysql
  database: gitorious_development
  username: root
  password:
  host: localhost
  encoding: utf8

# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
#
# If you want to use parallel_spec to run your tests in parallel, 
# you'll need to create databases for each test environment. 
# Change the database option to:
# 
# database: gitorious_test<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>
#
# And then create a database for each environment:
#
# script/db_console
# create database gitorious_test(n); #n = number of test env
#
# then run rake parallel:prepare[n]
#
# See http://github.com/grosser/parallel_specs/ for more info.
