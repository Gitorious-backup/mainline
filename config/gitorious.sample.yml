  # Messaging queue configuration
  # Gitorious ships with two message queue implementations; Stomp via the
  # ActiveMessaging gem and Resque. A TorqueBox implementation is on its way.
  # Possible values: stomp, resque, test, sync. Default value is stomp. The
  # test implementation is intended for unit testing only, not for production or
  # development use (messages are only stored in a list, never processed).
  # The sync adapter is intended for development use, but may also suit low
  # traffic setups where performance is not critical.
  messaging_adapter: stomp

  # The following settings are useful if you're interested in theming your
  # Gitorious install. Please note however, that we don't give any API
  # guarantees for view code, controllers or CSS. In fact, we plan to ditch most
  # of the existing CSS and JavaScript and replace it with a more modular system
  # (and significantly improved) markup sometime soon-ish, so use
  # "themes"/overrides at your own risk. In particular, we will not include
  # relevant theme information in the Changelog, so you will need to refer to
  # the git log if updating gives you trouble.

  # Additional stylesheets for most pages. "Most pages" is everything except for
  # the frontpage/public index, login page and the register page.
  #
  # One way to theme Gitorious would be to put a submodule in public/ that
  # contains stylesheets and images. Then include the following setting
  # (assuming that your submodule is at public/mytheme, and includes a directory
  # stylesheets/theme.css):
  #common_stylesheets: /mytheme/stylesheets/theme
  #
  # If you have several files:
  #common_stylesheets:
  #  - /mytheme/stylesheets/theme
  #  - /mytheme/stylesheets/theme2
  #
  # Note that the extra stylesheets will be added to the bundle used in
  # production

  # Additional stylesheets for the frontpage and login pages. Works like the
  # common_stylesheets setting
  #external_stylesheets: /mytheme/stylesheets/themed-public-index
