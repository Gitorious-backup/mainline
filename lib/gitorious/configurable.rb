# Look up values from multiple hashes in prioritized order, or use
# default values when no hash has a value for the corresponding key.
#
# If given an "env_prefix", the configurable will prefer environment
# variables if they exist. Given the prefix "GTS", attempting to look
# up "some_key" will result in the configurable trying the
# GTS_SOME_KEY environment variable before consulting any of the
# provided hashes.
#
# When Gitorious' initializers have run, Gitorious::Configuration is
# a globally shared instance of this class, used to interact with
# config/gitorious.yml.
#
# Sample usage:
#
#     # Look for env variables like $GTS_*
#     configurable = Gitorious::Configurable.new("GTS")
#
#     # Add some settings
#     configurable.append("variety" => "Jalapeno", "SHU" => "50000")
#     configurable.append("variety" => "Thai", "origin" => "Americas")
#
#     # Hashes are treated like a queue - first come, first serve.
#     # Hashes can be prepended to this queue if they are preferred
#     # sources:
#     shu_override = configurable.prepend("SHU" => "10000")
#
#     # Look up some values
#     configurable.get("variety") # "Jalapeno"
#     configurable.get("SHU")     # "10000"
#     configurable.get("origin")  # "Americas"
#
#     # Prune that SHU override we prepended:
#     configurable.prune(shu_override)
#
#     # Look up SHU
#     configurable.get("SHU")     # "50000"
#
# The configurable also supports renaming settings, and provides a
# mechanism for reacting to attempts at using the old/deprecated
# names:
#
#     configurable = Gitorious::Configurable.new
#     configurable.append("variety" => "Jalapeno", "heat" => "10000")
#     configurable.rename("heat", "SHU", "It's now called Scoville heat units")
#
#     configurable.on_deprecation do |old, new, comment|
#       $stderr.puts "Ohoi there! #{old} changed to #{new}: #{comment}"
#     end
#
#     configurable.get("heat") # "10000", and prints the above warning
#
# Renames can also have a transformation associated with them:
#
#     configurable.append("length" => "2in")
#     configurable.rename("length", "length_in_cm", "Metric FTW") do |old|
#       old.to_f * 2.54
#     end
#
#     configurable.get("length_in_cm") # 5.08
